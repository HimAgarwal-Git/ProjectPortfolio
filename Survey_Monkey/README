Hello World!!
This is my first repository in the world of datascience and analytics and here is a brief of what it contains:
1. The raw data contains the original file with data that was uncleaned and needed to be convereted to long data.
I used excel manipulation techniques and made use of python library PANDAS to bring these changes.
The final changes are in the OUTPUT FINAL file.
Visualizations have been done similar to Google Forms Analysis to bring out effective representation of data.
